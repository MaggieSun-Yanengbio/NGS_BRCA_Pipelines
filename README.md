# NGS_BRCA_Pipelines
Pipelines are developed to analyze NGS data for breast and lung cancers.

Steps to run the pipeline scripts:
1 trim the raw NGS read pairs;
2 align the trimmed fastq files to the reference DNA sequences;
3 perform the post-alignment filtration to discard low-quality alignment results and identify gene-specific primers within R1;
4 cluster the uniqe molecular barcodes within R2 and consolidate the read pairs having the same barcode sequences.
